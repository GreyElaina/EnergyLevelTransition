## Introduction

## Dependencies

## Setup Dev Environment

If you are using Windows, use the following style

```gradlew <task>```

or if you're using MacOSX/Linux/Unix:

```./gradlew <task>```

1. Firstly, clone ELT Project by executing `git clone https://github.com/MoegTech/EnergyLevelTransition.git` under your root directory. 

2. Rename your working directory into `ELT_Workspace` (not arbitrary), we call it the root directory. 

3. Then, Use IntelliJ or Eclipse to open `build.gradle` file in the root directory, and choose`import as project`. (Eclipse users might need to run `gradlew eclipse` after importing it)

4. Once Gradle is synced, you succeed partially!

5. Run `gradlew genSources` under root directory to generate Minecraft sources for reference. 

6. Run `gradlew build` under root directory to build artifacts in both `./ELT_Workspace/build/libs`, `./ELT_Workspace/elt/build/libs`, and `./ELT_Workspace/eltcore/build/libs`.

7. Run `gradlew :elt:runClient` to run Minecraft Client with entire ELT.

For more setup instructions or questions encountered please check the [fabric setup tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## Updating Minecraft

Sometimes, MC version changes in `gradle.properties`. 

Run `gradlew migrateMappings <version>` before building with the new version to get `remappedSrc` folder. Use the remapped source to replace the existing `src` folder. 
 
Run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh dependencies if anything went wrong.

Run `gradlew cleanLoom` to clean Loom cache. 

Delete the `{%USER-HOME%}/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom` folder if the you really screwed up.
